#### üß≠ Overview

Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) is the **identity and access management (IAM)** service for Azure, enabling secure authentication, authorization, and access control for users, applications, and devices.

This module focuses on managing users, groups, service principals, and managed identities ‚Äî the foundation of cloud security in Azure.

### üßë‚Äçüíª 1. Core Identity Components

| Component              | Description                                                                 | Use Case                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Users**              | Represents people, service accounts, or external partners (B2B).            | Login, resource access, identity governance                                   |
| **Groups**             | Logical collections of users for simplified access management.              | Assign roles or app access to groups instead of individuals                   |
| **Service Principals** | Identities for apps, services, or automation that need to access resources. | Terraform, GitHub Actions, or scripts accessing Azure securely                |
| **Managed Identities** | A special service principal managed by Azure for a resource.                | VMs, Function Apps, Logic Apps accessing other Azure services without secrets |

### üß© 2. Identity Lifecycle Management

1. **User Provisioning:** Create users manually, via bulk import, or through synchronization (Azure AD Connect).
2. **Access Assignment:** Apply roles (RBAC) or group membership for access.
3. **Monitoring:** Audit sign-ins and permission usage via **Azure Monitor**, **Entra Logs**, or **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.
4. **De-provisioning:** Disable or delete accounts when no longer needed; enforce lifecycle policies.

---

### üîê 3. B2B (Business-to-Business) Collaboration

* Allows inviting **external users (guests)** from other organizations to access internal resources.
* Guests maintain their own home credentials; Entra controls access via:

  * **Access packages**
  * **Conditional Access policies**
  * **Access reviews**

Example scenario:

> Partner developer needs access to an internal project repo ‚Äî invite them as a guest, assign to a specific group with limited permissions.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Recap

* RBAC controls **what actions** identities can perform on Azure resources.
* Assign roles at **scope levels**: Subscription ‚Üí Resource Group ‚Üí Resource.
* Built-in roles examples:

  * **Reader:** View-only
  * **Contributor:** Full management (no RBAC changes)
  * **Owner:** Full control, including permissions
  * **User Access Administrator:** Manage access rights

### üß± 5. Managed Identities (System + User Assigned)

| Type                | Description                                                       | Example                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **System-assigned** | Tied to one resource (like VM). Deleted when resource is deleted. | Azure VM needing Key Vault access               |
| **User-assigned**   | Standalone identity that can be attached to multiple resources.   | Shared identity for multiple automation scripts |

Benefits:
‚úÖ No password or secret management
‚úÖ Works natively with Azure RBAC
‚úÖ Supports least privilege principles

---

### üß† 6. Best Practices

* Enable **MFA** for all user accounts (especially global admins).
* Use **Conditional Access** policies for context-based security.
* Follow **least privilege** when assigning RBAC roles.
* Regularly perform **access reviews** and remove stale accounts.
* Monitor **sign-in logs** for unusual patterns (e.g., impossible travel).

### üîç 7. Hands-On Lab (Recommended)

**Objective:** Configure secure Entra identities and assign access.

1. Create a user and a group in Azure portal.
2. Assign RBAC role to the group.
3. Create a service principal using Azure CLI:

   ```bash
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name myApp --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<sub-id>
   ```
4. Create a managed identity for a VM and grant it Key Vault access.
5. Test sign-in and verify permissions using the **Access Control (IAM)** blade.

### üß© 8. Real-World Interview Tie-In

**Q:** Walk me through how you manage identities securely in Azure.
**A (STAR Format):**

* **Situation:** Our Azure environment had multiple unmanaged service principals and stale accounts.
* **Task:** Centralize and secure identity lifecycle.
* **Action:** Implemented Entra policies, automated provisioning via scripts, applied least privilege RBAC.
* **Result:** Reduced orphaned identities by 45%, improved compliance audit results.
